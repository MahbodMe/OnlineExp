            <h1>Explanation</h1>
            <p>In the Judd Illusion task, you saw a set of three lines forming a shape that looked like "->" or "-<". The center line "-<-" appear/ed to be displaced towards the obtuse angle (more open) in the "->" configuration then towards the acute angle (narrower) in the ">-" configuration. This illusion demonstrated how the context provided by the outer lines could influence your perception of the position and direction of the central line.</p>
            <p>In the Bisection Illusion task, you saw a line bisecting another line. Regardless of the actual length of the bisecting line compared to the bisected line, the bisecting line often appeared longer. Additionally, the point of bisection, regardless of its exact position on the bisected line, influenced the perceived length of the bisecting line. This illusion illustrated how the act of bisecting could distort your perception of line length.</p>
            <p>In both tasks, your perception of the target stimulus (the position and direction of the central line in the Judd Illusion, and the length of the bisecting line in the Bisection Illusion) was influenced by the surrounding context. By studying how individuals differed in their susceptibility to these illusions, we aimed to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms of human visual perception.</p>
